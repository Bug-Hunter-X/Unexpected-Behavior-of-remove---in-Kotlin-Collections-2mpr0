This repository demonstrates a potential source of confusion when using the `remove()` function in Kotlin with lists, sets, and maps. The `remove()` function removes the first occurrence of a specified element in a list, while it removes an element by value from a set or map.  The example code highlights this behavior. The solution shows how to handle these situations more robustly, potentially with more explicit checks or using alternate functions like `removeAll` for more complex removal scenarios.
